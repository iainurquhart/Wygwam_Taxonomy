# Wygwam Taxonomy Links

### Overview

Install this extension to have your Taxonomy Trees show up as link types in Pixel and Tonic's Wygwam Editor

This extension uses Wygwam's [wygwam_config](http://docs.pixelandtonic.com/wygwam/developers/wygwam_config.html) hook to allow publishers to select nodes from Taxonomy trees easily.

Install the extension and you'll see your Trees listed in the Wygwam link dialogue when creating links.
